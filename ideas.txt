Main ideas moving ahead next week is to implement a visual animation that visually gives the amount won to the player on the board they
won on. This will add alot of apeal and make the player want to go for the win even more. This means a couple of things need to happen:

1. Chips must generate in actual quantity based on user's balance. Generate chip function must give out certain denominations of chips
    based on amount available. inside of the chip container, we must add the chips in a way where you can see the stack of chips, this
    may mean something like making each stacks chips position absolute and when setting or genereating, translating by x amount based
    on the previous chips position. just an idea, implementation can be you choosing.
2. After a bet is won we give back the amount won in the same denomination of chips that the bet was placed with. 
3. Eventually, this can be last, we must have a cashier function or button to give out different denomination of chips.
